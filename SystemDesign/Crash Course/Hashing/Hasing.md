# Consistent Hashing

A type of hashing that minimizes the number of keys that need to be remapped when a hash table gets resized. It is often used by load balancers to distribute traffic to servers; it minimizes the number of requests that get forwarded to different servers when new servers are added or when exisiting servers are brought down

# Rendezvous Hashing

A type of hashing also coined **highest random weight** hashing. Allows for minimal re-distribution of mappings when a server goes down.

# SHA

Short for "Secure Hash Algorithms", the SHA is a collection of cryptographic hash functions used in the industry. These day, SHA-3 is a popular choice to use in a system.
