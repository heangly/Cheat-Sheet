# Key-Value Store

A key-value store is a flexible NoSQL database that is often used to caching and dynamic configuration. Popular options include DynamoDB, Etcd, Redis, and ZooKeeper.

## Etcd

Ecd is a strongly consistent and highly available key-value store that is often used to implement leader election in a system.

## Redis

An in-memory key-value store. DOes offer some persistent storage options but is typically used as a really fast, best-effort caching solution. Redis is also often used to implement **rate limiting**

## ZooKeeper

ZooKeeper is a strongly consistent, highly available key-value store. It is often used to store important configuration or to perform leader election.
