# Latency and Throughput

## Latency

The time it takes for a certain operation to complete in a system. Most often this measure is **time duration**, like milliseconds or seconds. You should know these orders of magnitude.

| ------------------------------------- | :-----: |
| Reading 1 MB fro **RAM**              | 0.25 ms |
| Reading 1 MB from **SSD**             |  1 ms   |
| Transfer 1 MB over **1 Gbps Network** |  10 ms  |
| Reading 1 MB from **HDD**             |  20 ms  |
| Inter-continetal Round Trip           | 150 ms  |

## Throughput

The number of operations that a system can handle properly per time unit. For instance the throughput of a server can often be measured in requests per second(RPS or QPS).
