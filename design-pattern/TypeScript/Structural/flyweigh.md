# What is Flyweight pattern?

- This pattern deals with managing efficient usage of memory or space resources by allocating some of the objects internally.
- With this pattern, you provide an interface, so the client can still benefit from using those objects but share them as well as much as possible behind the scenes
- One analogy of this pattern is sharing a few traditional costumes among many dancers. Because those costumes are very expensive to buy sometimes, some of the dancers may have to buy new ones but some may distribute them between performance
